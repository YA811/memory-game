## Game name: Memory Game

## Description:
it's a memory game that have 16 containers and each two of them have the same color so you just have to match all of them in order to win the game.

## so instructions to play the game:
it's already written when you start the game, but it's basically just matching two containers together as I said above, also when you get the colors wrong the will disappear after one second.

## Technologies used is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## for the future enhancement:
 So I added a timer already and some buttons, maybe for future enhancement also I will add levels to make it more and more harder.
